## Overview
This lab simulates a basic SOC environment by forwarding security logs from a Windows virtual machine into Azure Sentinel for analysis and investigation.

## What I Did
- Deployed a Windows virtual machine in Azure
- Configured a Log Analytics Workspace
- Enabled Microsoft Sentinel
- Configured log ingestion from the virtual machine
- Verified security event collection
- Used KQL queries to analyze security-related events
- Plotted attacks on global VM Attack Map via Sentinel Workbooks

## What This Demonstrates
- Understanding of cloud-based SIEM and SOC architecture
- Familiarity with log ingestion and analysis workflows
- Ability to investigate security events using KQL
- Experience working with Microsoft Sentinel in Azure
