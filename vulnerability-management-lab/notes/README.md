## Overview
This lab simulates a basic vulnerability management workflow by scanning a target system for known vulnerabilities, analyzing the results, and validating remediation efforts.

## What I Did
- Deployed a vulnerable target virtual machine
- Configured a vulnerability scanning tool
- Performed vulnerability scans against the target system
- Reviewed and interpreted scan findings
- Identified high- and medium-risk vulnerabilities
- Applied remediation steps to address selected findings
- Re-ran scans to validate remediation

## What This Demonstrates
- Understanding of vulnerability management fundamentals
- Familiarity with vulnerability scanning tools
- Ability to interpret and prioritize vulnerability findings
- Awareness of basic remediation and validation practices
- Clear security documentation and reporting skills
